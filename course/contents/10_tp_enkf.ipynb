This comparison helps evaluate whether the EnKF's estimated uncertainty (ensemble spread) is a good proxy for the actual errors.\n",

        "**General Observations:**\n",
        "*   For all three state variables, the `assimilated_spreads` generally follow the trend of the `absolute_errors`. This indicates that the EnKF is capturing some of the dynamics of the error evolution.\n",
        "*   In many regions, the `assimilated_spreads` tend to be slightly larger than the `absolute_errors`, suggesting that the ensemble is often a bit overconfident or that the perturbations are too small, leading to an underestimation of the actual uncertainty. Alternatively, it could mean the `obs_noise_std` or `initial_perturbation_std` might be slightly off. *Correction*: If the spread is *larger* than the errors, it means the ensemble is *overestimating* uncertainty, or is *under-confident*. If the spread is *smaller*, it's *underestimating* uncertainty, or *over-confident*.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   **Y-component (b):** Similar to the X-component, the spread often encapsulates the absolute error. However, there are instances, particularly during rapid changes in the true trajectory, where the spread might briefly underestimate the error or exhibit larger fluctuations than the error itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Z-component (c):** For the Z-component, the ensemble spread appears to be consistently smaller than the absolute errors for significant portions of the simulation. This suggests that the EnKF's uncertainty estimate for the Z variable might be too narrow, indicating potential overconfidence or a need to adjust parameters like `obs_noise_std` or the model error representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Time Periods of Inconsistency:**\n",
        "*   Across all components, especially the Z-component, there are phases where the `assimilated_spreads` are noticeably smaller than the `absolute_errors`. This implies that the ensemble is underestimating the true uncertainty during these periods. This could be due to issues like ensemble collapse (too small an ensemble size), insufficient model error representation, or issues with the observation model.\n",
        "*   Conversely, there are also times where the spread is significantly wider than the error, which might suggest that the ensemble is sometimes too diffusive or that the noise parameters are set too high.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "While the EnKF provides a reasonable estimate of the state and some indication of uncertainty, the comparison reveals areas for improvement. The ensemble spread does not perfectly align with the absolute errors, especially for the Z-component where the spread appears to be too narrow. This suggests that the current parameterization of the EnKF, or the representation of uncertainties, might need further tuning to ensure the ensemble spread is a more accurate proxy for the true uncertainty across all state variables."
